# Demo_code_sPICTURE
Demo code for Lateral Strain Imaging using Self-supervised and Physically Inspired Constraints in Unsupervised Regularized Elastography accepted in IEEE Transaction in Medical Imaging [1]. The network weights trained on experimental phantom data is provided here.  

## Install
The network architecture is MPWC-Net++ [2] which is a modified variant of PWC-Net irr [3]. Please follow the installation guide of original implementation of PWC-Net irr.
